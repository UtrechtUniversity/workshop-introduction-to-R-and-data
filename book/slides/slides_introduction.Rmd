.right-column[

- A widely used programming language for data analysis

- Based on statistical programming language S (1976)

- Developed by **R**oss Ihaka & **R**obert Gentleman (1995)

- Very active community, with many (often subject-specific) packages

- Open source, and interoperable!

- **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE) for R

- Founded by J.J. Allaire, available since 2010

- Bloody useful! Let’s take a look: please open RStudio!

# Course materials

#### All course materials, videos, information & resources are at  [tinyurl.com/introRDatasite](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-introduction-to-R-and-data/). 

### Slides & exercises

1. Download the [course materials here](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-introduction-to-R-and-data/raw/main/course-materials.zip).

2. Store it in a local (i.e. not on a mounted drive), accessible location.

3. Unzip the download to create a single folder.

4. If you have downloaded it, you will be able to tell us what animal is on the picture `animal.png`, located in the main folder :-)

---

# Open course materials

_Before you start: make sure you have downloaded the [course materials](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-introduction-to-R-and-data/raw/main/course-materials.zip), and unzipped them to a single, accessible folder._

1. Navigate to the folder with course materials

1. Double-click the **course-materials.Rproj** file.

1. From the ‘files’ menu (bottom right), click **baseR_exercises.Rmd**

---

# Running R code

# Do you expect an answer?

Saving information:
```{r}
x <- 1
```
Asking for information to be returned:
```{r}
x
```

Note the difference in syntax: when using the <- operator, you are storing the information as a variable in R, and therefore you do not expect to get an answer immediately.

When calling up that information, or making calculations, you can make R show you the answer.

---
# Maths functions

You can perform math with your variables:
```{r}
x * 3
```
and store the results as new variables:
```{r}
y <- x + 2

log2(y)
```

Check **"Maths Functions"** on the [cheat sheet](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf):

# Logicals

A logical is `TRUE` or `FALSE`, and can also be written as `T` or `F`.

Logicals are mostly used as tests:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| == | `==`  |is equal to |
| != | `!=` | is not |
| >= | `>=` | larger than or equal to |
| < | `<`  | smaller than |

For example:
```{r}
x == 6
x != 10
```

    ```
--

1. Test if the result is larger than 1.
    ```{r}
    x > 1

# Vectors in R

---
# Combining data: creating vectors
#### Vectors are created with the function `c()`

A numeric vector:
```{r}
c(1,2,3)
```

--

A character vector:
```{r}
c("a","b","c")
```

--

A logical vector:
```{r}
c(T,TRUE,F)
```

---
# Combining data: creating vectors

What is this vector?
```{r}
c(TRUE,"a",3)
```

--

#### Yep, a character vector!
Vector type defaults to the "lowest common denominator": everything can be a character, but not everything can be a number or a logical.

# Answers to exercise 2

1. _Meet Ann, Bob, Chloe, and Dan._ 
Create a character vector called "name" and add these names to the vector using the `c()` function.
    ```{r}
    name <- c("Ann", "Bob", "Chloe", "Dan")
    ```
--

1. _How old are Ann, Bob, Chloe, and Dan?_ 
Create a numeric vector called "age" and add their ages to the vector. You can decide their ages.
    ```{r}
    age <- c(35,22,50,51)
    ```
--

1. Use the `class()` function to check the data type of the `name` and `age` vectors.
```{r}
class(name)
class(age)
```


1. _What is their average age?_ 
Use a function in R to calculate this. 
**Tip:** use the Maths Functions section of the Base R cheat sheet!
    ```{r}
    mean(age)
    ```

# Programming: if statements

---
# If statement: a conditional

An if statement tests if a condition is TRUE or FALSE and exectues code depending on the outcome of that test.

![](images/ifstatement.png)

---
# If statement in R

- To build an if-statement, start with the function `if()`:
  ```r
  if()
  ```
--

- Within the `()`, insert the condition you want to test for:

  ```r
  if(number > 10)
  ```
--

- The code that should be executed if the condition is met is contained within the `{}`:

  ```r
  if(number > 10) {
    test_result <- "number is greater than 10"
}
  ```
--

- This code can be expanded to include what needs to be done if the condition is **not** met. For this, we use `else{}`

  ```r
  if(number > 10) {
    test_result <- "number is greater than 10"
} else {
  test_result <- "number is not greater than 10"
}
  ```
--

OLD
- First, let's assign a value to `number`:
  ```{r}
  number <- 14
  ```
--
- Here is the **if-statement**:
  - We test whether `number` is larger than 10 (the _condition_)
  - if true: we assign "over 10" to the variable `number_class` (our _instruction A_)
  - if false: we say that `number_class` is "10 or smaller" (our _instruction B_)
  ```{r}
  if(number > 10){
    number_class <- "over 10"
  } else{
    number_class <- "10 or smaller"
  }
  ```
--
- Now, let's look at `number class`:
  ```{r}
  print(number_class)
  ```

# Go to exercise 7

# Answers to exercise 7

Make an if statement that tests if a number is even, and saves the classification in a variable called `number_class`.

```{r}
number <- 8

if(number%%2 == 0){
  number_class <- "even"
} else{
  number_class <- "odd"
}

print(number_class)

# Programming: functions

---
# Functions: a sequence

#### Functions consist of (multiple) instruction(s) that form a cohesive unit:
![function](images/function.png)
--

#### A function can be repeated on different inputs:
```{r}
mean(df$age)
mean(1:100)
```

---
# Functions

#### Functions can also be used to make a complex line of code easier to write/read:

You write the function once:
```{r}
find_bobs_age <- function(data){
  bobs_age <- data[data$name == "Bob", "age"]
  return(bobs_age)
}
```

Now, every time you want to find Bob's age you use:
```{r}
find_bobs_age(df)
```

--

#### Functions are the bread and butter of programming!

A good script will consist mostly of functions, with a minimal amount of code that applies the functions.

---
# Functions in R

- To make a function, use the function `function()`:
  ```r
  myFun <- function()
  ```
--
- You assign names to the user's input in the function's arguments:
  ```r
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2)
  ```
--
- The sequence of operations is in the body of the function (between `{ }`):
  ```{r}
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2){
    multiplication <- arg1 * arg2 #<<
  }
  ```
--
- The output of the function is placed in a `return` statement:
  ```{r}
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2){
    multiplication <- arg1 * arg2
    return(multiplication) #<<
  }
  ```
---
# Using your own function

First, run the code with the function itself. It will appear in your environment:

![environment](images/function_environment.png)

--

Now, you can use the function:
```{r}
myFun(3,4)
myFun(90,71)
```

# Answers to exercise 8

Turn the if-statement from the last exercise into a function. Let the user provide the value for `number`, and return the `number_class`.

  } else{
    number_class <- "odd"

# A for-loop in R

- A loop starts with the iterable object (in this case the vector `1:6`), and the temporary name for each item (in this case `i`):
  ```r
  for(i in 1:6)
