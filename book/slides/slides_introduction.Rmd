# Introduction to R & Data

### Part 1: Basics of R

# What is R?

.left-column[
![rlogo](images/rlogo.png)]

.right-column[

- A widely used programming language for data analysis

- Based on statistical programming language S (1976)

- Developed by **R**oss Ihaka & **R**obert Gentleman (1995)

- Very active community, with many (often subject-specific) packages

- Open source, and interoperable!

# We will work in Rstudio

![rstudiologo](images/rstudiologo.png)

- **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE) for R

- Founded by J.J. Allaire, available since 2010

- Bloody useful! Let’s take a look: please open RStudio!

# The Rstudio interface

# Running R code

#### In a script/Rmarkdown document
- Place your cursor in the line of code you want to execute

- Press ![run](images/run.png) or ctrl + enter

- When running multiple lines: select all lines, then press ‘Run’ or ctrl+enter

#### In an Rmarkdown document
- You can execute a chunk as a whole with the green triangle:

# Open course materials

_Before you start: make sure you have downloaded the [course materials](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-introduction-to-R-and-data/raw/main/course-materials.zip), and unzipped them to a single, accessible folder._

1. In Rstudio, choose **File** > **Open Project**

1. Navigate to the folder with course materials

1. Open **course-materials.Rproj**

1. From the ‘files’ menu (bottom right), select **baseR_exercises.Rmd**

# Variable assignment

.pull-left[
You can assign both numbers and text to a variable:

```{r}
x <- 6

x <- 'apple'

x <- "hello world"

x = 6
```

# Do you expect an answer?

Saving information:
```{r}
x <- 1
```
Asking for information to be returned:
```{r}
x
```

Note the difference in syntax: when using the <- operator, you are storing the information as a variable in R, and therefore you do not expect to get an answer immediately.

When calling up that information, or making calculations, you can make R show you the answer.

---
# Maths functions

You can perform math with your variables:
```{r}
x * 3
```
and store the results as new variables:
```{r}
y <- x + 2

log2(y)
```

Check **"Maths Functions"** on the [cheat sheet](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf):

# Logicals

A logical is `True` or `False`, and can also be written as `T` or `F`.

Logicals are mostly used as tests:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| == | `==`  |is equal to |
| != | `!=` | is not |
| >= | `>=` | larger than or equal to |
| < | `<`  | smaller than |

For example:
```{r}
x == 6
x != 10
```

# Answers to exercise 1

1. Do the following calculation in R: _1 plus 5, divided by 9_
    ```{r}
    (1+5)/9
    ```
--

1. Assign the result of the calculation to a variable.
    ```{r}
    x <- (1+5)/9
    ```
--

1. Test if the result is larger than 1.
    ```{r}
    x > 1
    ```
--

1. Round off the result to 1 decimal.
    ```{r}
    round(x,1)
    ```

# Vectors in R

---
# Combining data: creating vectors
#### Vectors are created with the function `c()`

A numeric vector:
```{r}
c(1,2,3)
```

--

A character vector:
```{r}
c("a","b","c")
```

--

A logical vector:
```{r}
c(T,TRUE,F)
```

---
# Combining data: creating vectors

What is this vector?
```{r}
c(TRUE,"a",3)
```

--

#### Yep, a character vector!
Vector type defaults to the "lowest common denominator": everything can be a character, but not everything can be a number or a logical.

# Programming: if statements

---
# If statement: a conditional

- A test/condition: is this statement true or false?

- If the statement is true: do A

- If the statement is false: do B (this is optional!)

![](images/ifstatement.png)

---
# If statement in R

- First, let's assign a value to `number`:
  ```{r}
  number <- 14
  ```
--
- Here is the **if-statement**:
  - We test whether `number` is larger than 10 (the _condition_)
  - if true: we assign "over 10" to the variable `number_class` (our _instruction A_)
  - if false: we say that `number_class` is "10 or smaller" (our _instruction B_)
  ```{r}
  if(number > 10){
    number_class <- "over 10"
  } else{
    number_class <- "10 or smaller"
  }
  ```
--
- Now, let's look at `number class`:
  ```{r}
  print(number_class)
  ```

Make an if statement that tests if a number is even, and saves the classification in a variable called `number_class`.

  number_class <- "even"
} else{
  number_class <- "odd"

# Programming: functions

---
# Functions: a sequence

#### Functions consist of (multiple) instruction(s) that form a cohesive unit:
![function](images/function.png)
--

#### A function can be repeated on different inputs:
```{r}
mean(df$age)
mean(1:100)
```

---
# Functions

#### Functions can also be used to make a complex line of code easier to write/read:

You write the function once:
```{r}
find_bobs_age <- function(data){
  bobs_age <- data[data$name == "Bob", "age"]
  return(bobs_age)
}
```

Now, every time you want to find Bob's age you use:
```{r}
find_bobs_age(df)
```

--

#### Functions are the bread and butter of programming!

A good script will consist mostly of functions, with a minimal amount of code that applies the functions.

---
# Functions in R

- To make a function, use the function `function()`:
  ```r
  myFun <- function()
  ```
--
- You assign names to the user's input in the function's arguments:
  ```r
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2)
  ```
--
- The sequence of operations is in the body of the function (between `{ }`):
  ```{r}
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2){
    multiplication <- arg1 * arg2 #<<
  }
  ```
--
- The output of the function is placed in a `return` statement:
  ```{r}
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2){
    multiplication <- arg1 * arg2
    return(multiplication) #<<
  }
  ```
---
# Using your own function

First, run the code with the function itself. It will appear in your environment:

![environment](images/function_environment.png)

--

Now, you can use the function:
```{r}
myFun(3,4)
myFun(90,71)
```

# Answers to exercise 8

Turn the if-statement from the last exercise into a function. Let the user provide the value for `number`, and return the `number_class`.

  if(number%%2 == 0){
    number_class <- "even"
  } else{
    number_class <- "odd"
  }

# Programming: loops

# A for-loop

- Instruction(s) that need(s) to be applied multiple times

- Input is an iterable object (i.e.: it consists of multiple similar elements)

![forloop](images/forloop.png)
---
# A for-loop in R

- A loop starts with the iterable object (in this case the vector `1:6`), and the temporary name for each item (in this case `i`):
  ```r
  for(i in 1:6)
  ```
--
- Within the now familiar brackets (`{ }`) you place the instructions:
  ```{r}
  for(i in 1:6){
    print(i) #<<
  }
  ```

# Go to exercise 9

Go over the numbers 1-10, and for each number: test if the number is even or odd, using the function you made in the last exercise. Print the results using the function `print()`.

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  test <- even_or_odd(i)
  print(test)
}
```
