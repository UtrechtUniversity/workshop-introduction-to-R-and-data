# Introduction to R & Data {background-color=#FFCD00}
Part 1: Basics of R

## What is R
     
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- A widely used programming language for data analysis
- Based on statistical programming language S (1976)
- Developed by **R**oss Ihaka & **R**obert Gentleman (1995)
- Very active community, with many (often subject-specific) packages
- Open source, and interoperable!

## We will work in Rstudio

![](images/rstudiologo.png "r studio logo"){height="40%"}

- **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE) for R
- Founded by J.J. Allaire, available since 2010
- Bloody useful! Let’s take a look: please open RStudio!

## The Rstudio interface

## Variable assignment

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
You can assign both numbers and text to a variable:

```{r}
#| label: variable-assignment
x <- 6
x <- 'apple'
x <- "hello world"
```

    
You will see your variable (R object) appear in your Environment (top right panel).

See the `cheatsheets` folder. Or [download it](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/base-r.pdf).
:::

## Do you expect an answer?

Saving information as an R object:
```{r}
#| label: save-x
x <- 1
```
    
    
Asking for information to be returned:
```{r}
#| label: ask-x
x
```

Note the difference in syntax: 

- `<-` operator: storing information = no immediate 'answer'
- calling up an object, or making calculations: R shows you the answer


## Functions

Functions: code that performs a specific task based on the arguments provided.

Examples:

- `mean(x)`: calculate the mean of x
- `mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)`: calculate the mean of x by leaving out the NAs
- `getwd()`: print the working directory to the screen (requires no arguments)

. . .


:::{.callout-tip title="Help with functions"}
What does this function do, and what arguments does it need?

```r
?mean
```
:::

## Maths functions

You can perform math with your variables:
```{r}
#| label: multiply-x
x * 3
```
    
and store the results as new variables:
```{r}
#| label: store-calculation
y <- x + 2

log2(y)
```

## Logicals

A logical is `TRUE` or `FALSE`, and can also be written as `T` or `F`.

Logicals are mostly used as tests:

| | |
|---|---|
| `==`  |is equal to |
| `!=` | is not |
| `>=` | larger than or equal to |
| `<`  | smaller than |

For example:
```{r}
#| label: logicals
x == 6
x != 10
```

# Go to exercise 1 in baseR_exercises.Rmd

## Answers to exercise 1

1. Do the following calculation in R: _1 plus 5, divided by 9_
```{r}
#| label: exercise-1.1
(1+5)/9
```

. . .

2. Assign the result of the calculation to a variable.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-1.2
x <- (1+5)/9
```

. . .

3. Test if the result is larger than 1.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-1.3
x > 1
```

. . .

4. Round off the result to 1 decimal.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-1.4
round(x, 1)
```

# Vectors in R {background-color=#FFCD00}

## Combining data: creating vectors

**Vectors are created with the function `c()`**

A numeric vector:
```{r}
#| label: numeric-vector
c(1,2,3)
```

. . .


A character vector:
```{r}
#| label: character-vector
c("a","b","c")
```

. . .

A logical vector:
```{r}
#| label: logical-vector
c(T, TRUE, F)
```

## Combining data: creating vectors

What is this vector?
```{r}
#| label: combined-vector
c(TRUE, "a", 3)
```

. . .

    
**Yep, a character vector!**

Vector type defaults to the "lowest common denominator": everything can be a character, but not everything can be a number or a logical.

. . .
    
Order:

1. Character
2. Numeric
3. Logical

## Vector functions
**Vectors can be used in mathematical operations**

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

# Go to exercise 2

## Answers to exercise 2

1. _Meet Ann, Bob, Chloe, and Dan._ 
Create a character vector called "name" and add these names to the vector using the `c()` function.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-2.1
name <- c("Ann", "Bob", "Chloe", "Dan")
```

. . .

2. _How old are Ann, Bob, Chloe, and Dan?_ 
Create a numeric vector called "age" and add their ages to the vector. You can decide their ages.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-2.2
age <- c(35, 22, 50, 51)
```

. . .

3. Use the `class()` function to check the data type of the `name` and `age` vectors.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-2.3
class(name)
class(age)
```

## Answers to exercise 2 (continued)

4. _What is their average age?_ 
Use a function in R to calculate this. 
**Tip:** use the Maths Functions section of the Base R cheat sheet!
```{r}
#| label: avg-age
mean(age)
```

# Data structures {background-color=#FFCD00}

## Data structures: vector

**We have two vectors: `name` and `age`**

```{r}
#| label: name-age-vectors
name
age
```

How do we combine them?

. . .

**Into a one-dimensional vector: `c()`**
```{r}
#| label: vector-of-vectors
c(name,age)
```

## Data structures: data frame

How about combining `name` and `age` in a two-dimensional table structure?

. . .

```{r}
#| label: combine-in-df
data.frame(name, age)
```

Two dimensions:

- Rows
- Columns

## Data structures: list

Or: in a multi-dimensional list.

. . .

```{r}
#| label: combine-in-list
list(name, age)
```

Dimensions: *any*

Lists can contain *any* R object. 
Not just dataframes and vectors, but also other lists.

## Data structures: summary

&nbsp;

| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | number of dimensions  | &nbsp; function &nbsp; |
|---:|:---:|:---|
| vector | 1 | &nbsp; &nbsp; `c()` |
| data frame | 2 | &nbsp; &nbsp; `data.frame()`  |
| list | any number | &nbsp; &nbsp; `list()` |

NB: dataframes and lists appear under `Data` in the Environment (top right panel in RStudio), vectors under `Values`.

## Factors

**Special type of vector, defined by _levels_. Usually as categorical variable in a data frame.**

. . .

```{r}
#| label: factors
# Create vector country
country <- c("UK", "USA", "USA", "UK")
country

# Turn country into a factor
country_fac <- as.factor(country)
country_fac
```

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| label: factors-df
df <- data.frame(name, age, country_fac)
df
```
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| label: summary-factor-df
summary(df)
```
:::

# Go to exercise 3

## Answers to exercise 3

1. Create a vector called "country" containing four countries of your choice.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-3.1
country <- c("UK", "US", "NL", "BE")
```

. . .

2. Create a data frame called "df" combining name, age, and country.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-3.2
df <- data.frame(name, age, country)
```

. . .

3. Create a list called "mylist" with the 3 vectors and 1 dataframe you have just created. 
```{r}
#| label: exercise-3.3
mylist <- list(name, age, country, df)
```

# Go to exercise 5

## Answers to exercise 5

1. From your dataframe `df`, return all columns for everyone living in a country of your choice.

```{r}
#| label: exercise-5.1
df[df$country=="UK", ]
```

. . .

2. Return only the names of everyone in your data frame `df` under 40. 
```{r}
#| label: exercise-5.2
df[df$age<40, "name"]
```

. . .

3. Return the columns `name` and `age` together.
```{r}
#| label: exercise-5.3
df[, c("name", "age")]
```

# Missing data {background-color=#FFCD00}

## Not Available (NA)

Let's add a column to our data:
```{r}
#| label: na-df
df$pet <- c("cat", "none", "", NA)

df
```

. . .

Notice that:

- we know that Bob has no pets. 
- we do not know if Dan has pets.
- the value for Chloe is empty.

## Predict the answer (see Exercise 6)

```r
5 == 5
```

. . .

```{r echo = F}
#| label: 5-is-5
5 == 5
```

. . .

```r
5 == NA
```

. . .

```{r echo = F}
#| label: 5-is-na
5 == NA
```

. . .

```r
NA == NA
```

. . .

```{r echo = F}
#| label: na-is-na
NA == NA
```

. . .

```r
is.na(NA)
```

. . .

```{r echo=F}
#| label: is-na-na
is.na(NA)
```

. . .

**So: want to test if a value is NA? Use `is.na()`!**

## NULL: data does not exist

Do we know about our participants' jobs?

```{r}
#| label: select-job-null
# Select the column "job" from df
df$job
```

. . .

| | |
|---:|:---|
| `NA` | Information is **N**ot **A**vailable |
| `NULL` | Information does not exist |
| `none` or `0` | Data entry specifying content of 0 |
| `""` | Empty character value |

# Programming: if statements {background-color=#FFCD00}

## If statement: a conditional

An if statement tests if a condition is TRUE or FALSE and executes code depending on the outcome of that test.

![](images/ifstatement.png)

## If statement in R

- To build an if-statement, start with the function `if()`:
  ```r
  if()
  ```

. . .

- Within the `()`, insert the condition you want to test for:

  ```r
  if(number > 10)
  ```

. . .

- Within the `{}`, insert the code that should be executed if the condition is met:

  ```r
  if(number > 10) {
      test_result <- "number is greater than 10"
  }
  ```

. . .

- You can expand the statement with `else {}` if the condition is **not** met.

  ```r
  if(number > 10) {
      test_result <- "number is greater than 10"
  } else {
      test_result <- "number is not greater than 10"
  }
  ```

# Go to exercise 7

## Answers to exercise 7

Make an if statement that tests if a number is larger than 18. 
Assign the result to the variable `age_category`.

```{r}
#| label: exercise-7
number <- 8

if(number >= 18){
  age_category <- "adult"
} else{
  age_category <- "minor"
}

print(age_category)
```

Bonus exercise: expand the if-else statement to assign "toddler" if number is smaller than 2:

```{r}
#| label: exercise-7-bonus
number <- 8

if(number >= 18){
  age_category <- "adult"
} else if(number < 2) {
  age_category <- "toddler"
} else {
  age_category <- "minor"
}

print(age_category)
```

# Programming: functions {background-color=#FFCD00}

## Functions: a sequence

**Functions consist of (multiple) instruction(s) that form a cohesive unit**:
![function](images/function.png){width="45%"}


. . .

**A function can be repeated on different inputs:**

```{r}
#| label: mean-function
mean(df$age)
mean(1:100)
```

## Functions in R

- To make a function yourself, use the function `function()`:
  ```r
  myFun <- function()
  ```

. . .

- You assign names to the user's input in the function's arguments:
  ```r
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2)
  ```

. . .

- The sequence of operations is in the body of the function (between `{ }`):
  ```{r}
  #| code-line-numbers: "2"
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2){
      multiplication <- arg1 * arg2
  }
  ```
. . .

- The output of the function is placed in a `return` statement:
  ```{r}
  #| code-line-numbers: "3"
  myFun <- function(arg1, arg2){
      multiplication <- arg1 * arg2
      return(multiplication)
  }
  ```

## Using your own function

First, run the code with the function itself. It will appear in your environment:

![](images/function_environment.png "environment")

. . .

Now, you can use the function:
```{r}
#| label: use-myfun
myFun(3, 4)
myFun(90, 71)
```

## Functions

**Functions are the bread and butter of programming!**

A good script will consist mostly of functions, with a minimal amount of code that applies the functions.

. . .

```r
myFun <- function(arg1, arg2){
    multiplication <- arg1 * arg2
    return(multiplication)
}
```

Note that:

- arg1 and arg2 are **internal variables**: they do not exist outside of the function and they are used within the function to perform the code.
- The output of a function is always spit out using `return` (**not** `print`).

# Go to exercise 8

## Answers to exercise 8

Turn the if-statement from the last exercise into a function. Let the user provide the value for `number`, and return the `age_category`.

```{r}
#| label: exercise-8
test_age <- function(number){
  if(number >= 18){
    age_category <- "adult"
  } else{
    age_category <- "minor"
  }
  return(age_category)
}
```

. . .


```{r}
#| label: exercise-8-test-function
# Test the function
test_age(20)
test_age(2)
```

# Programming: loops {background-color=#FFCD00}

## A for-loop

- Perform the same action(s) for multiple inputs at a time
- Input is an object with multiple similar elements (e.g., a vector, row in a dataframe, etc.) that can be iterated over

![](images/forloop.png "For loop")

## A for-loop in R

- A loop starts with the iterable object (in this case the vector `1:5`), and the temporary name for each item (in this case `a_number`):
  ```r
  for(a_number in 1:5)
  ```

. . .

- Within `{ }`, you place the instructions:
  ```{r}
  #| code-line-numbers: "2"
  for(a_number in 1:5){
    print(a_number)
  }
  ```

. . .

Note that `a_number` is 1 in the first iteration of the loop, 2 in the second, etc. It does not exist outside the for loop!

# Go to exercise 9

## Answers to exercise 9

Go over the age column in your dataframe df, and for each age: `print()` the age category using the test_age function from the previous exercise.

```{r}
#| label: exercise-9
print(df$age)

for(the_age in df$age){
  test <- test_age(the_age)
  print(test)
}
```

## Answers Bonus question

Bonus question: add age category as a new column in df.

```{r}
# We first set an index that will be increased every time the for-loop runs
i <- 1

for(nr in df$age){
  # Add the age category to a new column in df
  df$age_category[i] <- test_age(nr)

  # Increase the index with 1 after running the code in this for-loop iteration
  i <- i + 1
}

df
```
