# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

R is a powerful programming language for data handling, data visualization, and statistics. In this workshop, we aim to give you the tools to start exploring R 
and all it has to offer by yourself.

The workshop will take you from the very basics in R syntax, to data handling and
visualization using a set of packages designed for data science, known as the 
`tidyverse`. We will also take some time to understand datasets and their 
architecture, preparing you to handle your own data in a clean, robust, and 
reproducible manner.

We will work in RStudio and introduce R scripts as well as the R Markdown 
format: the latter is a great way to combine code and its output with text, 
allowing you to code in a narrative and intuitive way. Moreover, this way you 
produce a human-readable document with which you can easily share and showcase 
your work.
