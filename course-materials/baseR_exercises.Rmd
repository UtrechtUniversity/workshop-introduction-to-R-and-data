#### Exercise 0: running R code

Try to run this code, by clicking the green 'Play' button.

```{r}
x <- 6

apple <- "apple"
```


### Exercise 1: R syntax & data types

1. Do the following calculation in R: one plus five, divided by nine.

2. Assign the result of the calculation to a variable.

3. Test if the result of your calculation is larger than 1.

4. Round off the result to 1 decimal. Tip: use the Maths Functions section of the Base R cheat sheet!

5. Write your code into the code chunk and press the green 'Play' button to execute.

```{r}


```


### Exercise 2: create vectors

1. _Meet Ann, Bob, Chloe, and Dan._ 
Create a character vector called "name" and add these names to the vector using the `c()` function.

2. _How old are Ann, Bob, Chloe, and Dan?_ 
Create a numeric vector called "age" and add their ages to the vector. You can decide their ages.

3. Use the `class()` function to check the data type of the `name` and `age` vectors.

4. _What is their average age?_ 
Use a function in R to calculate this. 
**Tip:** use the Maths Functions section of the Base R cheat sheet!

```{r}


```


### Exercise 3: combining data

1. Create a vector called "country" containing four countries of your choice.

2. Create a data frame called "df" combining name, age, and country.

3. Create a list called "mylist" with the 3 vectors and 1 dataframe you have just created. 

```{r}


```

### Exercise 4: selecting vector & list elements

1. Return only the first number in your vector age.

2. Return the 2nd and 4th name in your vector name.

3. Return only ages under 30 from your vector age.

```{r}

```


### Exercise 5: selecting from dataframe

Before you start, please run this code:
```{r}
rm(name,age,country)
```

1. From your dataframe df, return complete rows for everyone living in a country of your choice.

2. Return only the names of everyone in your data frame df under 40. 

3. Return the columns name and age together.
	
```{r}

```


### Exercise 6: predict the answer

Predict the results before you run the code. Does the real answer make sense to you?

```{r}
5==5

5==NA

NA==NA

is.na(NA)

```


### Exercise 7: if statement

Make an if statement that tests if a number is even, and saves the classification in a variable called number_class.

Hint: you can use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) to perform this test. This finds the remainder of a division. In R this operator is %%.
If the division is complete, e.g. 4/2 = 2, then the remainder, found with 4%%2, is 0.

```{r}
number <- 8

if(){
  
}

print(number_class)
```

### Exercise 8: function

Turn the if statement from the last exercise into a function. Let the user provide the value for number, and return the number_class.

```{r}

even_or_odd <- function(){
  
}

```

### Exercise 9: for-loop

Go over the numbers 1-10, and for each number: test if the number is even or odd, using the function you made in the last exercise. Print the results using the function print().

```{r}
for( in ){
  
}

```
