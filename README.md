## Workshop description

R is a powerful programming language for data handling, data visualization, and statistics.
In this workshop, we aim to give you the tools to start exploring R and all it has to offer by yourself.

The course will take you from the very basics in R syntax, to data handling and visualization using a set of packages designed for data science, known as the `tidyverse`.
We will also take some time to understand datasets and their architecture, preparing you to handle your own data in a clean, robust, and reproducible manner.
We will work in RStudio and introduce R scripts as well as the R Markdown format: the latter is a great way to combine code and its output with text, allowing you to code in a narrative and intuitive way.
Moreover, this way you produce a human-readable document with which you can easily share and showcase your work.
